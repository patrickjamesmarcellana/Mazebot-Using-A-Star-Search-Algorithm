# Mazebot-Using-A-Star-Search-Algorithm
This mazebot, designed for square mazes, implements the A* search algorithm to intelligently determine the optimal path toward the goal position, given a starting point. The start and goal positions set for the maze may be anywhere in the field. The mazebot will indicate if a solution cannot be found after exploring all possible paths.
